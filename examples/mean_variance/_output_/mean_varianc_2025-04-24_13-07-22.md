# Problem 001 (data row is 01) ((x3, x1, mean))

Consider the following sample,

* \(x_1\)=**1.0**
* \(x_2\)={:NUMERICAL:%100%2:0.05}
* \(x_3\)=**3.0**
 
and based on this sample, the following statistics are calculated:

* \(\bar x\) = **2.0**
* \(s_c^2\) = {:NUMERICAL:%100%1.0:0.05}
* variation coefficient = {:NUMERICAL:%100%0.5:0.05}
