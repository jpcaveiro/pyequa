# Problem problem given [x3, x1, x2] - CLOZE


## Variant 001 (data row is 01)

Consider the following sample,

* \(x_1\)=**1.0**
* \(x_2\)=**2.0**
* \(x_3\)=**3.0**
 
and based on this sample, the following statistics are calculated:

* \(\bar x\) = {:NUMERICAL:%100%2.0:0.05}
* \(s_c^2\) = {:NUMERICAL:%100%1.0:0.05}
* variation coefficient = {:NUMERICAL:%100%0.5:0.05}

## Variant 002 (data row is 02)

Consider the following sample,

* \(x_1\)=**2.0**
* \(x_2\)=**2.0**
* \(x_3\)=**4.0**
 
and based on this sample, the following statistics are calculated:

* \(\bar x\) = {:NUMERICAL:%100%2.667:0.05}
* \(s_c^2\) = {:NUMERICAL:%100%1.333:0.05}
* variation coefficient = {:NUMERICAL:%100%0.433:0.05}
