# Problem problem given [sig, alpha, lowergreater] - CLOZE


## Variant 001 (data row is 01)

Consider a right-tailed hypothesis test for the mean \(\mu\) of a Normal population with known variance:

H0: \(\mu = 5\) versus  H1: \(\mu > 5\)

Considering

* \(z_\text{obs}\) = {:NUMERICAL:%100%3.0902:0.001},
* p-value = {:MULTICHOICE_S:%100%0.001\~%0%0.05\~%0%0.01\~%0%0.3} = \( P(Z \ge  z_\text{obs}) \),
* \(\alpha\) = **0.01**

{:MULTICHOICE_S:%100%reject\~%0%don't reject} the null hypothesis (H0) because p-value **is lower** than \(\alpha\).

The expected value (population mean), \(\mu\), **is not significative** greater than 5.

## Variant 002 (data row is 02)

Consider a right-tailed hypothesis test for the mean \(\mu\) of a Normal population with known variance:

H0: \(\mu = 5\) versus  H1: \(\mu > 5\)

Considering

* \(z_\text{obs}\) = {:NUMERICAL:%100%1.6449:0.001},
* p-value = {:MULTICHOICE_S:%100%0.05\~%0%0.001\~%0%0.01\~%0%0.3} = \( P(Z \ge  z_\text{obs}) \),
* \(\alpha\) = **0.01**

{:MULTICHOICE_S:%100%don't reject\~%0%reject} the null hypothesis (H0) because p-value **is greater** than \(\alpha\).

The expected value (population mean), \(\mu\), **is significative** greater than 5.

## Variant 003 (data row is 03)

Consider a right-tailed hypothesis test for the mean \(\mu\) of a Normal population with known variance:

H0: \(\mu = 5\) versus  H1: \(\mu > 5\)

Considering

* \(z_\text{obs}\) = {:NUMERICAL:%100%2.3263:0.001},
* p-value = {:MULTICHOICE_S:%100%0.01\~%0%0.001\~%0%0.05\~%0%0.3} = \( P(Z \ge  z_\text{obs}) \),
* \(\alpha\) = **0.05**

{:MULTICHOICE_S:%100%reject\~%0%don't reject} the null hypothesis (H0) because p-value **is lower** than \(\alpha\).

The expected value (population mean), \(\mu\), **is not significative** greater than 5.

Considering

* \(z_\text{obs}\) = {:NUMERICAL:%100%0.5244:0.001},
* p-value = {:MULTICHOICE_S:%100%0.3\~%0%0.001\~%0%0.05\~%0%0.01} = \( P(Z \ge  z_\text{obs}) \),
* \(\alpha\) = **0.05**

{:MULTICHOICE_S:%100%don't reject\~%0%reject} the null hypothesis (H0) because p-value **is greater** than \(\alpha\).

The expected value (population mean), \(\mu\), **is significative** greater than 5.
