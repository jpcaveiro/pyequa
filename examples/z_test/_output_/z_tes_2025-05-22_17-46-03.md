# Problem 001 (data row is 01)

Consider a right-tailed hypothesis test for the mean \(\mu\) of a Normal population with known variance:

Considering

* \(z_\text{obs}\) = {:NUMERICAL:%100%3.0902\~%100%2.3263} (more than one solution; choose one) ,
* p-value = {:MULTICHOICE_S:%100%0.001\~%100%0.01\~%0%0.05\~%0%0.3} (more than one solution; choose one)  = \( P(Z \ge  z_\text{obs}) \),
