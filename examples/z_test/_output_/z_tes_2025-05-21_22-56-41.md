# Problem 001 (data row is 01)

Consider a right-tailed hypothesis test for the mean \(\mu\) of a Normal population with known variance:

H0: \(\mu = 5\) versus  H1: \(\mu > 5\)

Considering

* \(z_\text{obs}\) = **3.0902**,
* p-value = **0.001** = \( P(Z \ge  z_\text{obs}) \),

it follows that

* **reject** the null hypothesis (H0) because \(\alpha\) **is greater** than p-value.

Then, population mean (expected value) \(\mu\) {:MULTICHOICE_S:%0%is not significative greater\~%0%is significative greater} than 5.

# Problem 034 (data row is 02)

Consider a right-tailed hypothesis test for the mean \(\mu\) of a Normal population with known variance:

H0: \(\mu = 5\) versus  H1: \(\mu > 5\)

Considering

* \(z_\text{obs}\) = **1.6449**,
* p-value = **0.05** = \( P(Z \ge  z_\text{obs}) \),
* \(\alpha\) = {:MULTICHOICE_S:%0%0.01\~%0%0.05}

it follows that

* {:MULTICHOICE_S:%0%reject\~%0%don't reject} the null hypothesis (H0) because \(\alpha\) {:MULTICHOICE_S:%0%is greater\~%0%is lower} than p-value.

Then, population mean (expected value) \(\mu\) **is significative greater** than 5.

# Problem 035 (data row is 03)

Consider a right-tailed hypothesis test for the mean \(\mu\) of a Normal population with known variance:

H0: \(\mu = 5\) versus  H1: \(\mu > 5\)

Considering

* \(z_\text{obs}\) = {:NUMERICAL:},
* p-value = {:MULTICHOICE_S:%0%0.001\~%0%0.05\~%0%0.01\~%0%0.3} = \( P(Z \ge  z_\text{obs}) \),
* \(\alpha\) = **0.05**

it follows that

* **reject** the null hypothesis (H0) because \(\alpha\) {:MULTICHOICE_S:%0%is greater\~%0%is lower} than p-value.

Then, population mean (expected value) \(\mu\) **is not significative greater** than 5.

# Problem 036 (data row is 04)

Consider a right-tailed hypothesis test for the mean \(\mu\) of a Normal population with known variance:

H0: \(\mu = 5\) versus  H1: \(\mu > 5\)

Considering

* \(z_\text{obs}\) = {:NUMERICAL:},
* p-value = **0.3** = \( P(Z \ge  z_\text{obs}) \),
* \(\alpha\) = {:MULTICHOICE_S:%0%0.01\~%0%0.05}

it follows that

* **don't reject** the null hypothesis (H0) because \(\alpha\) {:MULTICHOICE_S:%0%is greater\~%0%is lower} than p-value.

Then, population mean (expected value) \(\mu\) **is significative greater** than 5.

# Problem 037 (data row is 01)

Consider a right-tailed hypothesis test for the mean \(\mu\) of a Normal population with known variance:

H0: \(\mu = 5\) versus  H1: \(\mu > 5\)

Considering

* \(z_\text{obs}\) = **3.0902**,
* p-value = {:MULTICHOICE_S:%100%0.001\~%0%0.05\~%0%0.01\~%0%0.3} = \( P(Z \ge  z_\text{obs}) \),
* \(\alpha\) = {:MULTICHOICE_S:%100%0.01\~%0%0.05}

it follows that

* **reject** the null hypothesis (H0) because \(\alpha\) {:MULTICHOICE_S:%100%is greater\~%0%is lower} than p-value.

Then, population mean (expected value) \(\mu\) **is not significative greater** than 5.
